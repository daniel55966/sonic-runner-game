An Infinite Runner Sonic the Hedgehog fan game built using Javascript. You control Sonic as he runs through a
city, avoiding or destroying enemies and gathering rings along the way. The object of the game is to get the
highest score and rank you can before losing.

If you want to test the game yourself, clone this repo and enter `npm run preview` in the terminal.
